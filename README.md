### Hello! Welcome to my github profile.

I am a programmer with a wide variety of skills and projects. I know many programming languages, like C++, Java, and Python to list a few, but I am always learning new things about programming.

I primarily do game development as a hobby, which led me to the Godot Engine (https://github.com/godotengine/godot), an open source game development platform that I have made several contributions to.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Either message me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email at michaelpalmern1@protonmail.com. If you have questions about my programming, ask! I enjoy explaining the logic behind my methods.
